# Calculator
A small calculator app for iPhone and Apple Watch, made with Swift

This app uses my custom math parser, [SwiftyMathParser](https://github.com/jaredrkozar/SwiftyMathParser). 

**FEATURES**

- Includes an Apple Watch app! Perform calculations, right from your wrist. Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and you can have it use the same theme as the iPhone app.

- can create and set custom themes (including using different colors for operators and numbers)

- Pick between 4 fonts, or you can select a font installed on your device.

- choose between 5 different alternate app icons to suit your preferences

- select rounding value for percise mathematical calculations

- can set a sound effect to play when you tap the buttons
